# Marine-Natural-Resource-Research-and-Extraction-Optimization-Project
## Overview
This project, conducted at Kocaeli University's Computer Engineering Department, aims to optimize natural resource exploration and extraction operations in oceans. The goal is to divide the search area into accurate and optimal parcels to maximize profits for a company involved in these operations.

## Getting Started
### 1. Prerequisites
 - Ensure you have SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library installed. You can find installation instructions here.
### 2. Installation
 - Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
 - Compile the project using a C/C++ compiler.
### 3. Usage
 - Run the compiled executable.
 - Input the necessary parameters when prompted (e.g., number of rows, unit drilling cost, unit platform cost).
## Project Structure
src/: Contains the source code files.
data/: Includes sample data files for testing the program.
images/: Provides visual representations for better understanding.

# How It Works
### 1. Data Input: The program reads coordinates from a text file via an internet connection. 
![data input](https://github.com/EmircanKartal/Marine-Natural-Resource-Research-and-Extraction-Optimization-Project/assets/88210656/4a3fb606-d008-4932-8a3e-78d867f2cfc4)
### 2. Processing: The coordinates are processed and converted into 2D closed area shapes.
### 3. Optimization: The areas are optimized by dividing them into square parcels, minimizing costs and maximizing profits.
### 4. Visualization: The optimized search areas are visually represented.
